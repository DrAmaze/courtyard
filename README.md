### Design Decisions to talk about

* State Shape
Adding drinks to state shape, and combining wine/beer.  It is important for a user to remember all of their drinks, as it is for Aporeto.

* Typecasting Reducer and actions
Creating more object models to ensure shape of state is maintained appropriately.

* Do API calls on the splash page
No because there isn't that much data

* Using the given ID for the unique identifier for list of drinks
Should generate UUID for each
